# Architect functions for OpenSearch / ElasticSearch

This package provides an automatically configured [client for OpenSearch](https://opensearch.org/docs/latest/clients/javascript/index/) in an [Architect](https://arc.codes/) application.

Pair this package with [@nasa-gcn/architect-plugins-search](https://github.com/nasa-gcn/architect-plugins-search), a [plugin](https://arc.codes/docs/en/guides/plugins/overview) that adds [Amazon OpenSearch](https://aws.amazon.com/opensearch-service/) to your application.
